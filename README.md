This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to iterate over an array using a loop that exceeds the array's bounds, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code, demonstrating the proper way to handle array iteration in Java. This is a frequent error that developers encounter when working with arrays, so understanding how to prevent and solve it is important.
